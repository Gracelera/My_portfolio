          I create with intent.

          The way I think and design is based around systems. Answering the questions of how and why something can grow, expand, and evolve is what drives my design process.

          I enjoy creating enjoyable but usable experiences for users who may not be familiar with tech solutions and I do it armed with a technical knowledge of how things work behind the scenes.
          ​
          My goal for every one of these projects is to build accessible products that excludes the least number of people possible. 
          ​
          Every user has unique needs and deserves to be designed for in a way that doesn't feel intrusive or highlight these needs in a negative way. Rather, it celebrates them using relatable, human and sometimes humorous language while delivering the an experience that maximises their efforts.

          My background as a software developer, love for aesthetics, intuitive user experience, and conquering challenging business goals build the foundation to all of my work.

          You can find me on YouTube educating aspiring designers, mentoring individuals on Superpeer, designing products for my shop, and freelancing as a design consultant.

          I am ready for my next challenge. Contact me and let’s jam.
